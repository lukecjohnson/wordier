# Wordier

[Wordier](https://wordier.xyz) is a daily word game where you unscramble a 5Ã—5
grid of letter tiles to make a valid 5-letter word with each row in 50 moves or less.

## Development

is used for bundling, transpilation, and minification. Run `npm run build` for
a production build or `npm run dev` to start a local development server.
